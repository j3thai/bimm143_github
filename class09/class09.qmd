## The PDB Database

The main databse for structural biology is called the PDB. Let's have a look at what it contains:

Download a CSV file from the PDB site (accessible from “Analyze” > “PDB Statistics” > “by Experimental Method and Molecular Type”. Move this CSV file into your RStudio project and use it to answer the following questions:


```{r}
stats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
stats
```

```{r pdbstats, message=FALSE}
library(readr)

stats <- read_csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
stats
```

```{r}
n.total <- sum(stats$Total)
n.total
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy. Give your answers to 2 significant figures.

```{r}
n.xray <- sum(stats$`X-ray`)
percent.xray <- (n.xray/n.total * 100)
```
There are `r round(percent.xray, 2)` percent X-ray structures in the PDB

```{r}
n.em <- sum(stats$EM)
percent.em <- (n.em/n.total * 100)
```
There are `r round(percent.em, 2)` percent X-ray structures in the PDB

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
round(stats$Total[1]/n.total * 100, 2)
```

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

There are about 957 HIV-1 protease structures.

## Exploring PDB Structures

```{r}
library(bio3d)

hiv <- read.pdb("1hsg")
hiv
```

Let's first use the Mol* viewer to explore this structure.

And a view of the ligand with catalytic ASP 25 amino-acids (spacefill) and all the important active site water molecule:

## PDB objects in R

```{r}
head(hiv$atom)
```

Extract the sequence
```{r}
pdbseq(hiv)
```

```{r}
chainA_seq <- pdbseq( trim.pdb(hiv, chain="A") )
```

I can interactively view these PDB objects in R with the new **bio3dview** package. This is not yet on CRAN. 

To install this I can setup **pak** package and use it to install **bio3dview** from GitHub. In my console I first run


```{r}
library(bio3dview)

view.pdb(hiv)
```

Change some settings

```{r}
sel <- atom.select(hiv, resno=25)

view.pdb(hiv, highlight=sel,
         highlight.style="spacefill",
         colorScheme= "chain", 
         col=c("blue", "orange"),
         backgroundColor= "pink")
```

## Predict protein flexibility

We can run a bioinformatics calculation to predict protein dynamics i.e. functional motions.

We will use the `nma()` function: 

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

Generate a "trajectory" of predicted motion

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="ADK_nma.pdb")
```

```{r}
view.nma(m)
```
